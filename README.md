# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a client who wanted to offer services to student drivers. These services involved practice driving sessions with teachers and online tests. The system they wanted was a website that could be used to purchase packages that offer different services depending on what the customer needs, and the website will be used to book driving appointments as well as taking online tests.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I managed to understand what the client wanted very well and managed to deliever a system that checks all their requirements. I never felt like I was confused or unclear about what the client wanted from their system.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would create better diagrams. I understood all the client's wishes and requirements for the system, but I think my diagrams could use some work.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I pictured myself in the shoes of the user. I imagined what I would expect a website to have, especially when it contains my personal information. When designing a system that will be used by a large number of people, it's important to consider that people will all kinds of technical background will be using it. It's important to understand that part of desiging and building a quality system that it not only works, but it also feels good to use as well.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I first review the main purpose/idea behind the client's system. What do they want it to do? Then I review all of the requirments that have been documented by meeting with the client. Anything special they want it do, platforms to run on, CLoud-based, etc. Drawing a visual reference for all requirements for my own personal use is an idea I might explore in the future.
